		In this laboratory we really get started with the biological content of this course.
		We have seen that replication is represented by the Exponential model:
			dx/dt = r*x

		where x is the size of a population and r is the specific growth rate of that population.
		This model generates the exponential growth story, for which we can formulate an exact model:
			x(t) = x0 exp(r*t), with doubling time T2 = ln(2)/r
		
		Suppose a particular bacteria population has a specific growth rate of r = 0.035 /min . Use
		the Julia REPL to calculate the population's doubling time.

		This number is enooormous! In fact, it is so enormous that it cannot be true! In the
		biological world, there is no such thing as exponential growth. Instead, as Darwin
		realised, limited resources always cause the population growth rate to drop as the
		population x gets bigger. This is modelled by the logistic equation:
			dx/dt = r*x*(1 - x/K)

		Here, r is the specific replication rate of the population only when x is much smaller
		than the resource limitation (carrying capacity) K. If x → 0, or if x → K, then the growth
		rate dx/dt → 0. In this case, the population has an unstable fixed point at x* = 0, but
		grows from any initial value x0 > 0 towards the stable fixed point at x* = K. (An asterisk
		denotes a fixed-point value.)

		Again using the value r = 0.035 /min from the previous activity, use a value of K = 100 to
		calculate the growth rate dx/dt of the bacteria population when x = 99.

		Suppose we have two exponential populations x and y that reproduce at different rates r and

			dx/dt = r*x and dy/dt = s*y, so that
			x(t) = x0*exp(r*t) and y(t) = y0*exp(s*t)

		Both x and y grow exponentially, and if r > s, x will grow faster than y. Eventually, there
		will be more x's than y's. Let's define ρ(t) ≡ x(t)/y(t). Use the quotient rule to prove
		that dρ/dt = (r - s)*ρ .

	Activity(
		"""
		The solution of this equation is ρ(t) = ρ0*exp((r - s)*t), so if r > s, ρ will grow toward
		infinity, and x outcompetes y. In addition, if we also suppose that resource are limited,
		the populations x and y will grow toward a point where the total population (x + y) stays
		constant, so that if x gets infinitely bigger than y, this must mean that y → 0.

		This is selection: where the growth of x drives y to extinction. For selection to happen,
		we need different rates of growth of the populations x and y, plus resource limitation.
		
		To study selection situations, we often use two simple modelling tricks:
		- We think of x and y not as populations, but as FREQUENCIES. That is, we assume that the
			sum of both population types is 1 (x + y = 1), so that x describes the proportion of
			the combined population that are x-individuals, while y describes the proportion that
			are y-individuals.
		- In addition, we think of the growth rates r and s as FITNESS values: r describes how
			fit the type x is, in terms of how effectively it grows by comparison with y.

		We want to make sure that the sum x + y = 1 of the two frequencies stays constant. To
		achieve this, we will reduce the growth rates of x and y by equal amounts R in the
		selection equations:
			dx/dt = (r - R)*x and dy/dt = (s - R)*y .
			
		Prove that this will only work if R is the average fitness of the two population types:
			R ≡ r*x + s*y .

		x -> true

	Activity(
		"""
		One advantage of using these selection model tricks is that y now depends upon x:
			y = 1 - x.
			
		Show that in this case, we can eliminate y from the two selection equations, so that we
		now only need to solve the single equation:
			dx/dt = (r - s)*x*(1 - x)

		"""
		We recognise this equation: it is the logistic equation with specific growth rate (r - s)
		and carrying capacity 1. We also know how the logistic story evolves over time - it has two
		equilibria at 0 and 1:
			If r > s, x → 1, so y → 0, and type x is selected over type y;
			If s > r, x → 0, so y → 1, and type y is selected over type x.

		Martin Nowak calls this model “Survival of the Fitter”. But there are many other exciting
		possible situations as well! :)

		By the way, before we proceed, you should beware of thinking of the frequencies x and y as
		species, because they might simply be different groups in a population of one species. It
		might even be that x's can genetically transform into y's. We shall refer to them here
		simply as "frequencies" or "types".

		We can extend this 2-type model to selection between N different types within a population.
		If we label the individual type frequencies x[i](t) (where i is in 1:N), the structure
		describing all N types is a vector: x ≡ [x1,x2, …, xN]. Now define r[i] ≥ 0 as the fitness
		of type i, then the average fitness of the entire population of N types is:
			R = sum([r[i]*x[i] for i in 1:N]), or simply dot(r,x)

		We can then write the selection dynamics model as:
			d(x[i])/dt = x[i]*(r[i] .- R)

		This is the general LINEAR SELECTION model. The frequency x[i] of type i increases if its
		fitness r[i] is higher than the population average R; otherwise x[i] decreases. However,
		the total population stays constant:
			sum(x) ≡ 1 and sum(dx/dt) ≡ 0

		We will find these relations very useful when we study the rise and fall of types within a
		population. In particular, we shall want to make use of the dot product between two
		vectors. At the Julia prompt, create two vectors a = [1,2,3] and b = [4,5,6], then verify
		that a'*b calculates the dot product of a and b. Then look up and tell me which library we
		need to load in order to make use of the dot product function: dot(a,b).

		The set of all values x[i] > 0 obeying the property that sum(x) = 1 is called a SIMPLEX.
		The useful thing about simplexes is that we can represent them both graphically and as
		coordinates. Given any two points P1 and P2 in the plane, we can represent any point on the
		straight line between P1 and P2 as a weighted average of P1 and P2. So, for example:
			(1,0)			corresponds to the point P1
			(0,1)			corresponds to the point P2
			(0.25,0.75)		corresponds to a point three-quarters of the way from P1 towards P2

		The coefficients of a weighted average are always frequencies that add up to 1, and we are
		using them here as coefficients that define a linear combination of the two points P1 and
		P2. Any linear combination whose coefficients add up to 1 is called a CONVEX COMBINATION.
