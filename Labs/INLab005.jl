		In this laboratory we look at the issue of encapsulation - a super-important topic in
		modern software engineering. If everyone is able to change the value of important variables
		in our program, this will make it EXTREMELY hard for people to understand exactly how our
		program works, so encapsulation HIDES data from unwanted changes. In particular, we want
		others to be able to understand, adapt and maintain our code. I have seen one firm come to
		bankruptcy because they forgot to use encapsulation properly. So how does it work?

		In a moment, you will discover that the variables inside a module or function have LOCAL
		SCOPE - that is, they are only visible and available inside that function, and not in
		the GLOBAL SCOPE outside the function.

		Sometimes, we are tempted to pass data from one function to another by storing that data
		in global variables, but this ALWAYS brings with it the danger that someone might change
		that data by accident, and so cause our program to crash! In this laboratory we investigate
		how to pass data in ways that protect it from being changed by accident.

		In our first experiment, enter the following code, then tell me the value of paula:

		linus = [5,4,3,2,1]; paula = 5
		""",
		"",
		x -> x==5
	),
	Activity(
		"""
		Now enter the following function:

		function change_paula()
			paula = 7
			paula
		end

		Then call the function change_paula() and tell me the value you get back:
		""",
		"Your result may (or not) surprise you, depending on how you think about scoping rules",
		x -> x==7
	),
	Activity(
		"""
		Your result shows us that the variable paula has two different meanings: the meaning in
		the GLOBAL scope outside the function change_paula, and the meaning inside the LOCAL
		scope of change_paula.

		Now tell me the current value of paula:
		""",
		"Ask Julia for the value of paula",
		x -> x==5
	),
	Activity(
		"""
		Aha! So although we can change the value of LOCAL paula inside the function change_paula(),
		this does not affect the value of GLOBAL paula. In fact, there exist two different variables
		named paula: the GLOBAL variable containing the value 5, and a LOCAL variable containing
		the value 7. When change_paula() ends, the variables in its local scope are thrown away,
		and the LOCAL paula disappears.

		If we REALLY want to change the global value of paula, we can do so by redefining the
		function change_paula():

		function change_paula()
			global paula = 7
			paula
		end

		NOTE: Doing this is a Very Bad Idea! Tell me the value of paula now:
		""",
		"",
		x -> x==7
	),
	Activity(
		"""
		So Julia does allow us to make use of global values inside a local scope, but it forces us
		to announce this by using the keyword "global".

		There is a further issue here. Enter this code:

		function change_linus()
			linus[3] = 7
			linus
		end

		Again, the return value tells us that we are able to change the value of a local variable
		named linus. But now tell me the value of the GLOBAL variable named linus:
		""",
		"",
		x -> x==[5,4,7,2,1]
	),
	Activity(
		"""
		The point here is that linus is a Vector that refers to its contents (5,4,3,2,1). Julia
		does not allow us to change the value of linus, however it DOES allow us to change the
		CONTENTS that linus refers to. So global variables are still unsafe! What are we to do?
		The solution is this:

			ALWAYS encapsulate (i.e.: wrap/hide) EVERYTHING you do inside a MODULE!

		Modules offer a very effective of preventing our variables and code from being changed by
		other programmers. Let's see how to do this. Enter the following code:

		module MyModule
			function change_paula1()
				global paula = 9
				paula
			end
		end

		Now call MyModule.change_paula1(), then tell me the value of paula afterwards:
		""",
		"",
		x -> x==7
	),
	Activity(
		"""
		OK, so putting change_paula1() inside the module MyModule means it cannot interfere
		with the value of our global variable paula. But wait! We know that we can load
		modules into global scope by means of the keyword "using": will that make it possible
		for users change paula's value by accident? Load the module MyModule now:

		using .MyModule

		Repeat the previous experiment - what is the value of paula afterwards?

		Great! Now that we know how to hide variables and functions inside a module, we can do
		some real live software development! In the next laboratory, we will develop a genetic
		algorithm (GA), and GAs need to work with arrays of random values. However, generating
		random numbers is very time-expensive, so in this laboratory we will develop a software
		tool called a Casino that will later help us generate arrays of random values very quickly.

		There is just one thing we need to do first. Our modules can get quite complex, so we
		will build them up step-by-step within a file. If you look in the directory
		Ingolstadt/Development/Altruism, you will find a file named Replicators.jl. Open this file
		now and study its contents. What is the name of the data type defined in the file?

		You can use Replicators.jl as a general template for designing any new module. Whenever
		you want to create a new module, I recommend that you simply copy the file Replicators.jl
		to a new file, then change its contents to suit your own needs.

		Notice several things about Replicators.jl. First, it contains just one module called
		Replicators, and in this module the data type Replicator is defined. It provides no further
		code other than the use-case unittest() for the code that we will now implement. A use-case
		is a user program that tests the code that we intend to write. So, for example, we intend
		to write a function run!() that will run a Replicator simulation, so unittest() calls this
		function, but for now I have commented out the call because we haven't yet implemented it.

		Now read and parse the file Replicator.jl. You can do this either by using the Play button
		in VSC or else by entering the following Julia code from inside the Ingolstadt folder:

		include("src/Development/Altruism/Replicators.jl")

		It is important that our use-case runs correctly, because it is the starting-point for
		developing and testing all our software. Run the use-case now by calling the function
		Replicators.unittest() and tell me in which line of code you get your first error:

		"",
		x -> x==46

	Activity(
		"""
		As you can see, Julia tells us that we have not yet defined a method for the function
		run!(). We will have to do that later, but for now, just comment out the three lines in
		which run!() is called, and check that Replicators.unittest() now runs correctly without
		errors.

		Now we will develop our Replicators module by making successive changes to the file
		Replicators.jl. We will start by thinking about how to construct a Replicator. At present,
		we need to specify the timescale, timestep and timeseries in line 41, but of course we
		don't know the value of the timeseries until the Replicator simulation has run. Also, it
		is more convenient for users if they only have to enter the duration and timestep of the
		simulation in line 41. For example, change line 41 to look like this:

			repl = Replicator(5,1)

		Now recompile and run unittest() and tell me in which line you get an error:
		""",
		"Where does unittest() start looking for a constructor that looks like Replicator(5,1)?",

		To fix this error, we must implement an appropriate constructor. In fact, we don't really
		want users to use the default constructor Replicator(t,dt,x) at all! We can block this by

		of the data type Replicator to like this:

		Finally, you will now apply your exponential model to the problem of drinking and driving.
