		Arrays play a very fundamental role in Julia, so we need to learn how to access them
		efficiently. In this laboratory we learn how to index into arrays in Julia - that is,
		how to use indices to access and manipulate the entries in an array. We will also look
		at various ways of applying code to the elements in an array.
		
		Julia offers four kinds of indexing: SUBSCRIPTING, LINEAR indexing, MULTIPLE indexing
		and LOGICAL indexing. All four are extremely useful for scientific programming. To
		investigate these forms of indexing, first create a (4x4) matrix by reshaping a range:

			m = reshape(1:16,(4,4))

		First notice the order in which Julia has placed the numbers 1:16. Do they run down the
		columns or along the rows?

		"""
		So: SUBSCRIPTING! To access a matrix element with subscripts, we use square brackets
		enclosing two subscripts i (row) and j (column) like this: m[i,j]. In Julia, the row
		index ALWAYS comes before the column index! Display the element m[3,4[] now, then tell
		me its value:

		We have already used the colon operator to create ranges of numbers, for example 1:3 can
		be collected into a vector [1,2,3]. We can also use ranges to select regions of an array.
