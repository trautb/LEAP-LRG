		Hi! In this laboratory we will use activities and questions to introduce ourselves to the
		basics of the Julia language. Feel free to experiment at any time by entering your own
		commands at the Julia prompt.
		
		I will interpret anything you enter as an argument of the function reply() as an answer to
		the current question. Try this now - at the Julia prompt, enter the following code:

			city = "Ingolstadt"

		Then enter your answer as:
		
			reply(city)
