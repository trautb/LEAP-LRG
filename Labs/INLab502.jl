	Another important function from the Toolbox is eigvec. An eigenvector can
	be created with a linear transformation and is a scaled vector.
	This concept is especially important if we want to find the best agent value (nutrient source)
	in a neighbourhood. If the model has two agent positions a you want to go from
	one to another. It is recommended to use eigvec if the model searches for an better
	value.
